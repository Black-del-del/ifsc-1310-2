    <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
    <u1>I find that access to the internet has become increasingly necessary, to the point that not having at least some access to it can lead to significant difficulty in modern day life. Whether this be finding a job, a home, a car, or even contacting others, the internet is needed. This is why the internet being accesible to those with disabilitys is very important. Whether it be those with physical disabilities that require helpful programs/devices such as eye trackers that move the mouse for them or AI that let the user speak and work the computer without ever touching it physically, these tools are needed and valuable. I find that web accessability is both a vital and needed field that will continue to advance to match everyones needs.</u1>
